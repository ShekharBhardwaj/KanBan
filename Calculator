Let’s consider an example where multiple peers give positive feedback, but a single feedback provider with a higher weight (such as a Direct Manager) gives a low score. This can skew the overall score to be more negative due to the weight assigned to that single provider’s feedback.

Scenario

We have four categories: Peers, Partner, Direct Manager, and Skip-Level Manager. Here’s how the feedback looks:

	1.	Peers (4 feedback providers): Positive scores — 4, 4.5, 5, and 4.2
	2.	Partner (1 feedback provider): Neutral score — 3.5
	3.	Direct Manager (1 feedback provider): Low score — 1.5
	4.	Skip-Level Manager (1 feedback provider): Neutral score — 3.5

Assuming we want each category to contribute equally (0.25 weight) to the overall score, the Direct Manager’s low score could have a strong negative impact because it’s weighted at 0.25 alone, compared to the 0.25 weight shared by all the peers.

Step-by-Step Calculation

Peers

Each peer’s weight would be 0.25 / 4 = 0.0625. Calculating for each peer’s feedback:

	•	Peer 1: ￼
	•	Peer 2: ￼
	•	Peer 3: ￼
	•	Peer 4: ￼

Total for Peers: ￼

Partner

	•	Partner 1: ￼

Direct Manager

	•	Direct Manager: ￼

Skip-Level Manager

	•	Skip-Level Manager: ￼

Total Weighted Score

Now, adding all these together:

Analysis of Skewed Result

Even though the peers provided mostly high scores (4, 4.5, 5, and 4.2), the Direct Manager’s single low score of 1.5 has a significant negative impact on the total score because it holds a full 0.25 weight, just like the entire Peers category combined.

If we calculate the average for each group individually:

	•	Peers’ Average: (4 + 4.5 + 5 + 4.2) / 4 = 4.425
	•	Overall Score without the Manager’s Score would have leaned much more positively if each category had contributed similarly based on the number of providers.

How to Address This Skew

If the goal is to ensure fairness while avoiding such a skew, consider:

	1.	Weighted Distribution Adjustment: Adjust the weight so that no single provider holds a full 25% if the other categories have multiple contributors.
	2.	Mixed Weight Approach: Add a buffer to heavily-weighted single inputs if they significantly differ from the rest, ensuring they don’t completely dominate the outcome.

This approach can balance out the influence, making sure that one low score doesn’t disproportionately skew an otherwise positive overall result.
