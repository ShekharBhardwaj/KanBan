For the outlined project, a structured roadmap with phased implementation will ensure that the development process is orderly, milestones are clearly defined, and the team can efficiently manage tasks. The project involves several key steps: onboarding the JSON object specification, receiving data from SOMOS, processing and securing the data through various internal systems, and finally converting the JSON data to PDF format and publishing the metadata. Here’s a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Planning and Design

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Collect all the necessary requirements from stakeholders, including the specifications for the 1099 form data, security requirements, and the final output expectations.
2. **Architecture Design**: Design the overall system architecture, including how each component interacts with others, data flow, and security protocols.
3. **Technology Stack Selection**: Decide on the technology stack for the project, including the programming languages, database, cloud services (AWS for SQS and Lambda), and tools for encryption and tokenization.
4. **Security and Compliance Review**: Get the incoming JSON object specification reviewed by the ISO and data team to ensure compliance with security policies.

### Phase 2: Onboarding and Initial Setup

1. **Onboard JSON Specification to OneStream and Exchange**: Configure OneStream and Exchange to accept and correctly process the incoming JSON object according to the specification.
2. **Set Up Development Environments**: Ensure all developers have access to the necessary tools and environments for development, testing, and deployment.
3. **Implement Reverse Proxy (Exchange)**: Configure the reverse proxy to receive events via webhook and forward them to the enterprise API (SDPv4).

### Phase 3: Core Development

1. **Enterprise API Integration (SDPv4)**: Develop the API functionality to handle incoming data, including writing to OneStream.
2. **Data Processing in OneStream**: Implement the logic to decrypt NPI data, tokenize it, and integrate with the internal API to retrieve the SSOID of the customer.
3. **Republishing to OneStream**: Develop the functionality to republish the processed object to OneStream, ensuring the data format is suitable for downstream processing.

### Phase 4: Data Routing and Conversion

1. **QSink Configuration**: Utilize QSink to push the second JSON object to SQS, ensuring the data format and routing are correctly configured.
2. **AWS SQS and Lambda Integration**: Set up SQS to trigger a Lambda function that converts the JSON object to a PDF and implements logic for publishing metadata from JSON and PDF to the gallery.

### Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assuranc
1. **Unit Testing**: Perform unit testing on individual components to ensure they work as expected in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test the integrated system to ensure that data flows correctly through each component and the overall system behaves as intended.
3. **Security Testing**: Conduct security testing to ensure that data encryption, tokenization, and other security measures are effective.

### Phase 6: Deployment and Monitoring

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the application to the production environment, ensuring all components are correctly configured and integrated.
2. **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging to track the system’s performance and identify any issues promptly.

### Phase 7: Review and Maintenance

1. **Post-Deployment Review**: After deployment, review the system's performance, gather feedback from stakeholders, and identify any areas for improvement.
2. **Maintenance and Updates**: Regularly update the system to address any issues, improve performance, and add new features as required.

Ensure that each phase is followed by a review meeting with stakeholders to validate the completion of milestones and gather feedback. This phased approach allows for iterative development, testing, and deployment, ensuring that the system meets all requirements and functions as intended.
