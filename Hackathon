 we are considering an AI-powered chatbot to reduce turnaround time. This chatbot will automate actions triggered by PagerDuty alerts, performing the series of quick checks that an engineer would typically do after waking up and logging in. For example, if a PagerDuty alert comes in at 3 a.m. about an API sending non-200 error statuses, instead of manually investigating, our AI-powered bot will step in.

The bot will take intuitive actions like calling the API in production to verify if the alert is valid, gathering data on the number of failures, and determining whether the issue affects specific clients or is widespread. It will also check for recent deployments, analyze the code, and highlight potential problem areas, such as deployment changes or lines of code that could be causing the issue. Additionally, it will perform checks like confirming if this is a regional API issue.

By the time you log in, the bot will have already completed these checks and provided a summarized report. From there, you can interact with the bot directly to continue troubleshooting. For instance, you could ask how many instances are running in a specific region, request the IP of an instance, verify if security groups are correctly attached, or check whether an instance has the appropriate IAM policies and access to S3 buckets. The bot will respond to these simple, English-language prompts by taking the necessary actions. It will also suggest next steps while you chat, such as offering to check whether client credentials were properly updated in the vault after a rotation.

This intuitive chatbot will streamline the initial investigation process and make it easier to debug issues in real-time.
